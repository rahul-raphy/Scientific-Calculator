# Scientific-Calculator
Scientific Calculator Using Python is a calculator that can be used to solve issues in science, engineering, and mathematics. It features a lot more buttons than a typical calculator, which only allows you to perform the four basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

About Project
_____________
This project was made with Python. This python application is developed to convert entered integers into any operations and to handle any type of exception, according to the system’s features.
Furthermore, the system is designed in such a way that the user will have no difficulty using it.
Additionally, this is a simple GUI-based project that is easy to understand and use. Furthermore, this project offers an easy method for users to learn how to perform numerical calculations.
Moreover, The project features numbers, operators, and signs, much like a conventional calculator. As a consequence, the user can enter any number they want or simply click on the numbers they want in the computations. As a result, this application can be used as a simple calculator by the user.

Modules used
____________
1.Tkinter- is the standard GUI library for Python. Tkinter provides various controls, such as
buttons, labels and text boxes used in a GUI application. These controls are commonly
called widgets. There are currently 15 types of widgets in Tkinter such as button, label, listbox,
menubutton, messagebox, radiobutton, scrollbar, text etc.
To create a GUI application using Tkinter, we need to do is perform the following steps:
i)Import the Tkinter module.
ii)Create the GUI application main window.
iii)Add one or more of the above-mentioned widgets to the GUI application.
iV)Enter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user.

2.Math module- provides functions to deal with both basic operations such as addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/) and advance operations like trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential functions. Math module provides various the value of various constants like pi, Euler’s number etc.


Stepwise Implementation
________________________
Import modules Tkinter and math.

Create geometry or a so-called layout for the GUI of the calculator by using Tkinter.

Create a menu bar of the calculator GUI.

Create all the functions of the scientific calculator so that they can be called and perform easily.

Create a number pad for the calculator. 

Place all the buttons/operators in their respective position in the grid. Set them as per our choice by changing their row and column value.
